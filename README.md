# Keep Unlocks
Lethal Company plugin.

Saves certain unlockables when the run resets. Configurable to keep suits, furniture, and/or ship upgrades.

Suits automatically re-appear on the rack and ship upgrades return to their starting position. By default, all other furniture returns to storage.

This mod is host only - clients do not need to install and it will have no effect if you aren't host.
